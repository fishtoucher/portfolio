			<h1>Seven</h1> <br>
			<p style="line-height: 35px;">Seven is a productivity app designed from an engineering approach based on human psychology and motivation. Users can write down a weekly goal (or choose one from the app’s directories), and Seven will suggest tasks ordered by difficulty which can be added to a personalized list of metrics that defines the data to be logged.  </p>

			<h2> Approach </h2>
			<p>Initially, the prompt was quite generous - "Life-logging app". I did some thinking and looked into existing products to narrow the scope of the project down to something that wasn't confined to one topic (finance, excercise, healthy eating etc.) and promoted short term goal-setting and time management skills.</p>

				<br>
				<img src="pics/croptop21.jpg" width="700px" >
			</div>	
			<p>Seven does not require its users to commit to one type of goal; users can be committed to healthy eating one week, and if it’s not to their liking, they can switch to gardening the next. 

			Seven provides space for the user to build on existing interests or grow in new directions, which fundamentally sets it apart from most life-logging apps.</p>
			<h2>What keeps users coming back?</h2>

			<p>Seven has a “progression bar”; every time a user logs their data, the bar fills up a bit more. By the end of the week, the bar will be full  whether or not the user reached their goals. This prevents the users from being discouraged and works towards building a habit of daily logging – users can feel good every time they log a bit of data. 

			Seven also awards “badges”, which are charming graphic stickers that can be obtained by hitting certain goals.</p>

			<p>Seven satisfies the need for instant gratification and flexibility, all the while promoting the ability to set short term goals and encouraging the user to try new things. </p>
